# Waste-segregation-system-using-Iot

In response to escalating environmental concerns, this paper presents a comprehensive waste management system comprising two pivotal phases. Phase1 addresses the imperative need for efficient waste segregation. By harnessing a suite of sensors—IR, ultrasonic, and soil moisture sensors—coupled with the ESP32 microcontroller, our system autonomously segregates solid and liquid waste, addressing the contamination issue prevalent in conventional disposal methods. Real-time monitoring via the Thing Speak cloud platform offers remote access to waste levels, empowering responsible waste disposal practices. Phase 2 builds upon this foundation by introducing autonomous movement capabilities to the waste collection process. The integration of user-friendly interfaces enables seamless monitoring and control of the dustbin's movements, resolving traffic congestion issues associated with manual waste collection. This innovative approach not only revolutionizes waste segregation but also mitigates traffic and pollution concerns through a cloud-managed, systematically operated moving bin. The presented system stands as a beacon of sustainable waste management, offering a pragmatic solution to global environmental challenges
